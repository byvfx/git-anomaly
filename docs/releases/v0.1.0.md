# v0.1.0 - Foundation Establishment

**Release Date**: TBD  
**Classification**: Safe → Euclid

## 🎯 Mission Summary

Initial containment protocols established for SCP-████. Basic Git learning simulation operational with full SCP Foundation theming.

## ✅ Containment Procedures Implemented

### Core Git Commands
- `git init` - Initialize containment repository
- `git add` - Stage files for containment  
- `git commit` - Secure files in containment
- `git status` - Monitor repository status
- `git branch` - Manage containment branches
- `git checkout` - Switch between containment branches

### Foundation Infrastructure
- Complete CLI interface with Cobra framework
- SCP-themed terminal output with color coding
- Anomaly level tracking system (0-100%)
- Researcher sanity monitoring
- Containment status indicators (SECURE/BREACH/CRITICAL)

### Educational Scenarios
