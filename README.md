# SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà: The Self-Modifying Codebase

An interactive CLI game that teaches Git concepts through an SCP Foundation horror/mystery narrative.

## üéÆ About

You are a newly assigned Junior Researcher in the SCP Foundation's Digital Anomalies Division. Your assignment: contain an anomalous self-modifying codebase using proper Git procedures. But be careful - each command you execute teaches the entity more about our reality...

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Notice**: This game is currently in early development. Features, gameplay mechanics, and story elements are subject to change. Some planned features may not yet be implemented.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/byvfx/git-anomaly.git
cd git-anomaly

# Build the game
make build

# Run the game (modern TUI interface)
make run

# Or run with classic CLI interface
./bin/scp-git --classic
```

### Alternative: Direct Go Run

```bash
# Modern TUI interface (default)
go run main.go

# Classic CLI interface
go run main.go --classic
```

## üéØ How to Play

> **üìã Note**: The modern TUI interface is temporarily on hold while we focus on perfecting the core CLI experience. The classic CLI now provides the complete game with all enhanced features including tab completion and command history.

### Enhanced CLI Interface (Current)
Experience the complete game through our improved command-line interface featuring:
- üöÄ **Tab Completion**: Smart completion for all git commands, filenames, and branch names
- üìú **Command History**: Navigate previous commands with up/down arrows
- üéì **Official Git Tutorial**: 4 progressive levels following proven Git learning structure
- üé® **SCP Theming**: Full Foundation aesthetic with color-coded output
- üîß **Advanced Git Commands**: Complete git workflow from config to merge

### Gameplay
1. Type `start` to begin containment protocols
2. Follow the progressive 4-level Git tutorial:

#### Level 1: Initial Containment Setup
   - `git config user.name "Your Name"` - Configure researcher identity
   - `git config user.email "email@site.com"` - Set contact protocol
   - `git init` - Initialize containment repository
   - `git add .` - Stage all discovered files
   - `git commit -m "Initial containment"` - Secure files

#### Level 2: Monitoring Changes
   - `git status` - Check for autonomous modifications
   - `git diff` - Analyze specific changes made by the entity
   - `git commit -a -m "Document changes"` - Commit all tracked modifications

#### Level 3: Historical Analysis
   - `git log` - Review complete containment timeline
   - `git log -p` - Examine detailed change history
   - `git show <commit>` - Investigate specific incidents

#### Level 4: Parallel Containment Strategies
   - `git switch -c strategy-a` - Create experimental branch
   - `git merge strategy-a` - Integrate successful approaches

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Use **Tab** for command completion
   - Use **Up/Down arrows** for command history
   - Type `brief` to review current level objectives
   - Type `help` for complete command reference

4. Monitor your stats:
   - **Anomaly Level**: Increases with mistakes (100% = game over)
   - **Researcher Sanity**: Decreases with stress (0% = game over)  
   - **Containment Status**: SECURE ‚Üí BREACH ‚Üí CRITICAL

## üìö Game Progression

Following the official Git tutorial structure for optimal learning:

### Level 1: Initial Containment Setup
Configure your researcher identity and establish version control for all discovered files. Learn the fundamentals of Git initialization and committing.

### Level 2: Monitoring Changes  
Track autonomous entity modifications using status and diff commands. Learn to document and commit changes as they occur.

### Level 3: Historical Analysis
Investigate the entity's behavior patterns through commit history. Master log analysis and forensic examination techniques.

### Level 4: Parallel Containment Strategies
Implement multiple containment approaches using branches, then merge successful strategies. Advanced workflow management.
