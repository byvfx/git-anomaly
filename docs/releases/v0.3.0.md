# v0.3.0 - Classic CLI Foundation

**Release Date**: 2025-07-13

## Overview

Version 0.3.0 represents a major architectural shift towards a streamlined classic CLI experience. This release removes the TUI framework dependencies and simplifies the game mechanics while maintaining the core educational Git learning experience.

## Major Changes

### Removed TUI Framework
- **Removed bubbletea dependency**: Eliminated the Bubble Tea TUI framework to simplify the codebase
- **Removed lipgloss dependency**: No longer using lipgloss for terminal styling
- **Classic CLI as default**: The game now runs exclusively in classic command-line mode
- **Simplified dependencies**: Reduced from 5 to 3 primary dependencies

### Simplified Game Mechanics
- **Removed sanity system**: Eliminated the researcher sanity tracking mechanism
- **Removed breathe command**: No longer needed without sanity mechanics
- **Streamlined feedback**: Focused purely on anomaly level and Git learning
- **Cleaner status displays**: Simplified status information to essential metrics

### Enhanced CLI Experience
- **Readline integration**: Full tab completion for commands and file names
- **Smart autocomplete**: Dynamic completion for Git branches and files
- **Command history**: Persistent command history across sessions
- **Better error handling**: Clearer error messages without sanity penalties

## Technical Improvements

### Dependencies
- **Before**: cobra, bubbletea, lipgloss, readline, color + 25+ indirect dependencies
- **After**: cobra, readline, color + 5 indirect dependencies
- **Reduced binary size**: Significantly smaller executable
- **Faster startup**: Removed TUI initialization overhead

### Code Quality
- **Simplified architecture**: Removed complex TUI state management
- **Better maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer moving parts and state transitions
- **Improved testability**: Easier to test CLI interactions

## Breaking Changes

- **No TUI mode**: The `--tui` and `--classic` flags have been removed
- **Sanity commands removed**: Commands like `breathe` no longer exist
- **Status output changed**: No longer displays researcher sanity percentage
- **Different visual styling**: Uses basic terminal colors instead of lipgloss styling

## Educational Features

### Maintained Learning Experience
- **Git tutorial progression**: All educational levels remain intact
- **SCP theming**: Maintained immersive Foundation narrative
- **Command validation**: Proper Git syntax checking and feedback
- **Progressive difficulty**: Structured learning from basic to advanced Git concepts

### Enhanced Usability
- **Tab completion**: Auto-complete for Git commands, branches, and filenames
- **Command suggestions**: Better error messages with suggested corrections
- **History navigation**: Arrow keys for command history browsing
- **Consistent interface**: Uniform command-line experience across platforms

## Installation

This version maintains the same installation methods:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvfx/scp-git-game/main/scripts/install-unix.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvfx/scp-git-game/main/scripts/install-windows.ps1 | iex

# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/byvfx/scp-git-game.git
cd scp-git-game
go build -o scp-git ./cmd
```

## Migration Notes

Users upgrading from v0.2.0 should note:

1. **No configuration changes needed**: Game progress and settings remain compatible
2. **Command changes**: Remove any scripts using the `breathe` command
3. **Status monitoring**: Update any external monitoring that relied on sanity metrics
4. **Visual differences**: Terminal output styling will look different but remain functional

## Future Roadmap

This release establishes a solid foundation for future development:

- **v0.4.0**: Enhanced Git command coverage (rebase, cherry-pick, stash)
- **v0.5.0**: Multi-level campaign with branching storylines
- **v1.0.0**: Complete Git tutorial coverage with advanced scenarios

## Acknowledgments

This release focuses on simplicity and educational effectiveness, removing unnecessary complexity while maintaining the core learning experience that makes SCP-████ an effective Git teaching tool.
