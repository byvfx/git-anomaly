# SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: The Self-Modifying Codebase
## Interactive Git Learning Game Project Plan

### Project Overview
A CLI-based interactive game that teaches Git concepts through an SCP Foundation horror/mystery theme. Players take on the role of a Foundation researcher tasked with containing an anomalous self-modifying codebase using proper Git procedures.

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go
- **Primary Dependencies**: 
  - `cobra` (CLI framework)
  - `readline` (classic CLI input handling)
  - `color` (terminal colors)
- **Target**: Cross-platform CLI application

Educational Framework (Based on Official Git Tutorial)
Our SCP containment training follows the proven structure from the official Git documentation:
Level 1: Initial Containment Setup
Objective: Establish basic containment protocols

Git Tutorial Section: "Importing a new project"
Commands: git config, git init, git add ., git commit
SCP Context: Setting up initial containment for SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ

Level 2: Monitoring Changes
Objective: Track anomalous modifications to the codebase

Git Tutorial Section: "Making changes"
Commands: git add, git status, git diff, git commit -a
SCP Context: The entity is modifying files - document all changes

Level 3: Historical Analysis
Objective: Investigate the entity's past behavior

Git Tutorial Section: "Viewing project history"
Commands: git log, git log -p, git log --stat, git show
SCP Context: Analyzing timeline of anomalous activity

Level 4: Parallel Containment Strategies
Objective: Test multiple containment approaches simultaneously

Git Tutorial Section: "Managing branches"
Commands: git branch, git switch, git merge, git branch -d
SCP Context: Running parallel experiments to contain the entity

Level 5: Multi-Site Collaboration
Objective: Coordinate with other Foundation sites

Git Tutorial Section: "Using Git for collaboration"
Commands: git clone, git pull, git remote, git fetch
SCP Context: Sharing containment data between Foundation facilities

Level 6: Advanced Investigation Techniques
Objective: Deep forensic analysis of the anomaly

Git Tutorial Section: "Exploring history"
Commands: git grep, git tag, git diff, git reset, commit references (HEAD^, etc.)
SCP Context: Advanced analysis to understand the entity's true nature

go build -o bin/scp-git ./cmd
```

### Code Quality Standards

- Use `golangci-lint` for static analysis
- Maintain consistent code formatting with `gofmt`
- Write meaningful commit messages (ironically important for a Git game!)

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for each phase
- Pull requests with thorough testing
- Semantic versioning for releases
- Detailed commit messages explaining changes

---

## Notes for Claude Code

### When Testing Components:
1. Start with basic functionality before adding theming
2. Test each Git command individually before combining
3. Verify error handling works correctly
4. Check terminal output formatting on different screen sizes

### Debugging Tips:
- Use `fmt.Printf` for debugging game state
- Test with various terminal types (bash, zsh, PowerShell)
- Verify ASCII art displays correctly
- Check color output on different terminals

### File Organization:
- Keep SCP documents in separate text files for easy editing
- Use embedded files for ASCII art
- Separate game logic from presentation logic
- Make components testable in isolation

---

## MVP Definition

### Minimum Viable Product for Phase 1:

- Working CLI with Simulation Protocol that teaches the first 3 levels of Git commands
- Commands: git config, git init, git add, git commit, git status, git diff, git log
- SCP theming with proper incident reports and containment documentation
- Educational progression that matches official Git tutorial structure
- Clean error handling with Foundation-appropriate terminology
- Cross-platform compatibility
