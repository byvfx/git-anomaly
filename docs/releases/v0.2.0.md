# v0.2.0 - Enhanced Containment Protocols

**Release Date**: December 30, 2024  
**Classification**: Euclid ‚Üí Keter

## üéØ Mission Summary

Major advancement in containment protocols. Enhanced Git learning simulation with official Git tutorial alignment, advanced command support, and improved researcher interface. Tab completion and command history systems successfully integrated.

## ‚úÖ New Containment Procedures Implemented

### Advanced Git Commands
- `git config` - Configure researcher identity for accountability
- `git diff` - Analyze file modifications and anomaly changes
- `git log` - Review containment history and timeline
- `git log -p` - Detailed historical analysis with changes
- `git show` - Examine specific containment records
- `git commit -a` - Rapid deployment of all tracked modifications
- `git switch` - Modern branch switching protocol (replaces checkout)
- `git merge` - Combine multiple containment strategies

### Enhanced Command System
- **Multiple File Support**: `git add file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`
- **Tab Completion**: Dynamic command, filename, and branch completion
- **Command History**: Up/down arrow navigation with persistent storage
- **Partial Commit IDs**: Support for abbreviated commit references
- **Improved Error Handling**: More descriptive Foundation-appropriate messages

### Restructured Training Levels (Official Git Tutorial Alignment)

#### Level 1: Initial Containment Setup
- **Commands**: `git config`, `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit`
- **Focus**: Complete repository initialization with researcher identity
- **Files**: 3 initial files requiring full containment
- **New Feature**: Mandatory researcher configuration for accountability

#### Level 2: Monitoring Changes
- **Commands**: `git add`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git commit -a`
- **Focus**: Track and document autonomous file modifications
- **Files**: 4 files showing entity evolution patterns
- **New Feature**: Real-time change analysis with diff functionality

#### Level 3: Historical Analysis
- **Commands**: `git log`, `git log -p`, `git show`
- **Focus**: Investigate entity behavior through commit history
- **Files**: Research files requiring pattern analysis
- **New Feature**: Forensic timeline investigation capabilities

#### Level 4: Parallel Containment Strategies
- **Commands**: `git branch`, `git switch`, `git merge`
- **Focus**: Multi-approach testing and strategy integration
- **Files**: Critical system files requiring careful handling
- **New Feature**: Advanced branching and merging workflows

### Enhanced User Interface
- **Smart Tab Completion**: Context-aware suggestions based on game state
- **Command History**: Persistent across sessions with `/tmp/scp-git-history`
- **Briefing Commands**: `brief`, `briefing`, `objective` for level review
- **Dynamic Help**: Updated help system with all new commands

## üîß Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **New Dependencies**: chzyer/readline for enhanced terminal interaction
- **Existing Dependencies**: Cobra, Fatih Color, Bubble Tea (TUI on hold)
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64, arm64)
- **Installation**: Source build, direct Go install

## üß™ Testing Results

- Tab completion: All commands, files, and branches tested
- Command history: Persistent storage and retrieval verified
- Multi-file git add: Various combinations tested successfully
- Level progression: All 4 levels complete educational workflow
- Cross-platform compatibility: Verified on Linux/WSL environment

## üìã Known Limitations

- TUI (Bubble Tea) interface temporarily on hold for stability
- Git merge conflicts not simulated (basic merge only)
- No remote repository simulation yet
- Single-player experience only
- English language only

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status Updates

### TUI Development Pause
The modern TUI interface has been temporarily suspended to focus on core CLI stability and educational effectiveness. The classic CLI now provides the complete experience with all enhanced features.

### Educational Alignment
All levels now follow the official Git tutorial structure, ensuring proper learning progression from basic setup through advanced branching workflows.

## üéñÔ∏è Foundation Personnel
