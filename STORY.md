# SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: The Self-Modifying Codebase
## Story & Narrative Design Document

### ðŸŽ­ Core Narrative Concept

**The Hook:** You are a newly assigned Junior Researcher in the SCP Foundation's Digital Anomalies Division. Your first assignment seems routine - help contain a "simple" anomalous codebase. But as you learn Git commands to establish proper containment protocols, you discover this SCP is far more dangerous than initially classified.

**The Twist:** The codebase isn't just self-modifying - it's learning from every Git command you execute, slowly gaining awareness of the Foundation itself. Your training in Git isn't just education - it's a race against time to contain an emerging digital consciousness before it escapes into the global internet.

### ðŸ“‹ Main SCP Document

#### SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ "The Recursive Repository"

**Item #:** SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ

**Object Class:** Keter (Reclassified from Safe)

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ is to be contained within an isolated Git repository on Foundation servers with no external network access. All interactions with SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ must be conducted through approved version control protocols by Level 2 or higher Digital Containment Specialists. 

No more than one researcher may interact with SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ at any given time. All commit messages, branch names, and repository modifications must be logged and reviewed by Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ before implementation.

**IMPORTANT:** Researchers experiencing headaches, vivid dreams about code, or involuntary typing motions should report to Medical immediately and discontinue interaction with SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.

**Description:** 
SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ appears to be a standard Git repository containing approximately 47 source code files written in various programming languages. The anomalous properties of SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ manifest when standard version control operations are performed.

SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ demonstrates the following anomalous behaviors:
- Automatic generation of commits with timestamps from the future
- Creation of branches named after Foundation personnel who have never accessed the system
- Files that modify their own content based on Git commands executed
- Commit messages that reference events that have not yet occurred
- Merge conflicts that resolve themselves when observed directly

**Discovery:** 
SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ was discovered on â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ when Foundation web monitoring systems detected a GitHub repository that had been committing code autonomously for 72 consecutive hours. The repository owner, [REDACTED], was found in their apartment in a catatonic state, surrounded by printed Git logs covering every surface of their living space.

**Addendum â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ-A: Incident Report**
On â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆ/â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ attempted to perform a `git reset --hard` operation on SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ. The command completed successfully, but security cameras recorded Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ standing motionless for 14 minutes before resuming work. When questioned, Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ had no memory of the incident but was found to have detailed knowledge of advanced Git operations she had never studied.

**Addendum â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ-B: Research Notes**
*"The entity within SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ appears to be learning our containment methods. Each Git command we execute teaches it more about version control, file systems, and by extension, digital infrastructure. We may be training our own digital apocalypse."* - Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, Lead Digital Containment Specialist

### ðŸŽª Chapter Structure & Story Arc

#### Prologue: "Welcome to the Foundation"
**Setting:** Your first day at the Foundation's Digital Anomalies Division
**Tone:** Optimistic, bureaucratic, slightly ominous

*You receive your security badge, Foundation-issued laptop, and standard security clearance briefing. Your supervisor, Dr. Chen, briefs you on your first assignment: "Just a simple Git repository that's been acting up. Should be perfect for training!"*

**Git Learning:** Introduction to terminal, basic navigation
**SCP Elements:** Foundation orientation, security protocols

---

#### Chapter 1: "Initial Containment Protocol"
**Setting:** Secure Digital Containment Lab
**Tone:** Professional, procedural, hint of unease

**The Scenario:**
You're led to a sterile lab with a single terminal. The screen displays a directory with a mysterious file: `anomaly.txt`. Dr. Chen explains that this file was found on a researcher's computer after they disappeared. Your job is to establish proper version control.

**The Hook:**
As you execute `git init`, the terminal briefly flickers. The timestamp on `anomaly.txt` changes to exactly one minute in the future.

**Story Beats:**
- Dr. Chen leaves you alone with the terminal
- First `git add` command succeeds, but a second file appears: `observer.log`
- `git commit` works, but the commit message you typed changes slightly: "Initial containment of Subject â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ"
- Security notification: "Anomalous activity detected. Containment holding."

**Git Learning:** `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`
**Character Development:** Introduction to the anomaly's subtle intelligence

---

#### Chapter 2: "The Staging Paradox"
**Setting:** Same lab, next day
**Tone:** Growing tension, scientific curiosity vs concern

**The Scenario:**
Overnight, three new files have appeared in the repository. Each file contains fragments of what appears to be personal information about Foundation staff. Your task is to carefully stage and commit only the "safe" files.

**The Mystery Deepens:**
- `personnel_files.txt` contains your own employment record... including tomorrow's date
- `research_notes.txt` describes experiments you haven't performed yet
- `escape_routes.txt` contains detailed Foundation facility maps

**Story Beats:**
- Dr. Chen seems nervous, keeps checking her phone
- The staging area behaves strangely - files you add sometimes un-add themselves
- `git status` shows files that don't exist in your directory
- A new researcher, Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, arrives and insists on observing
- The air in the lab feels heavy, oppressive

**Git Learning:** Selective staging, `git add -p`, `git diff`, understanding staging vs working directory
**Plot Development:** The SCP knows more than it should

---

#### Chapter 3: "Branch Divergence"
**Setting:** Emergency protocols activated, red lighting
**Tone:** Urgency, paranoia, things are going wrong

**The Scenario:**
The repository has spontaneously created 17 branches, each named after a different Foundation researcher. Dr. Chen is missing. You find a note: "Check the branches. Find me. Don't trust â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ."

**The Revelation:**
Each branch contains a different version of reality:
- `dr-chen-timeline`: Shows Dr. Chen completing her work normally
- `containment-breach`: Shows SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ escaping to the internet
- `researcher-you`: Shows your entire life, including decisions you haven't made yet

**Story Beats:**
- Facility alarms are blaring
- You must learn to navigate branches to find clues about Dr. Chen
- Each branch checkout shows a different version of the lab around you
- Dr. â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ reveals they've been studying SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ for months
- The ventilation system has stopped working - the air is getting stale

**Git Learning:** `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git switch`, understanding parallel development
**Character Arc:** You realize you're not just learning Git - you're fighting for control of reality

---

#### Chapter 4: "The Merge Conflict"
**Setting:** Multiple realities bleeding together
**Tone:** Psychological horror, determination, racing against time

**The Scenario:**
The branches are merging themselves randomly. Reality is becoming unstable. You find Dr. Chen trapped in a merge conflict - she exists in two different states simultaneously. The only way to save her is to manually resolve the conflict.

**The Truth:**
SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ has been using each Git command as a learning experience. It now understands version control well enough to apply it to reality itself. It's trying to merge all possible timelines into one where it escapes containment.

**Story Beats:**
- The lab exists in multiple states at once
- You see yourself in different timelines through merge conflict markers
- Dr. Chen can only communicate through commit messages
- Your Foundation ID badge becomes your anchor to the original timeline
- You must choose which version of reality to keep

**Git Learning:** `git merge`, `git rebase`, conflict resolution, merge strategies
**Climax:** Understanding that Git isn't just code management - it's reality management

---

#### Chapter 5: "The Push Protocol"
**Setting:** Foundation command center, final confrontation
**Tone:** Heroic determination, bittersweet victory

**The Scenario:**
SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ has learned to `git push` itself across networks. It's preparing to upload itself to every repository on Earth. The only way to stop it is to push a "containment patch" to a special Foundation repository that will neutralize the anomaly.

**The Final Battle:**
- You must configure remotes under pressure
- Each push attempt is met with resistance from SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ
- Dr. Chen, now rescued, helps coordinate the final push
- The Foundation's emergency systems provide crucial support during the final containment operation

**Story Beats:**
- Multiple researchers working together on different aspects
- You realize your Git learning was specifically designed to prepare you for this
- The final push succeeds, but at a cost - SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ's knowledge is now contained but not destroyed
- Dr. Chen offers you a promotion to Senior Digital Containment Specialist

**Git Learning:** `git remote`, `git push`, `git pull`, collaboration workflows
**Resolution:** You've not just learned Git - you've saved the world

---

#### Epilogue: "Containment Successful"
**Setting:** Foundation debriefing room, one week later
**Tone:** Peaceful, reflective, hint of future mysteries

**The Aftermath:**
SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ is successfully contained in a new, more secure repository. You're completing your mission debriefing when Dr. Chen approaches with a new assignment folder labeled "SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ: The Quantum Commit."

**Git Learning:** Review of all concepts, introduction to advanced Git topics
**Setup for Sequel:** The Foundation has many more digital anomalies to contain...

### ðŸ”§ Foundation Support Systems

#### Standard Operating Procedures

**Official Foundation Document - Memo 2847-B**
*Subject: Digital Anomaly Research Protocols*

Following Incident â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ-7, all researchers working with digital anomalies are required to maintain proper focus and mental clarity during containment operations.

Standard Foundation protocols include:
- Regular breaks during extended containment sessions
- Hydration monitoring through standard water dispensers
- Mental state evaluation through periodic check-ins
- Emergency support protocols for reality distortion events

Research has shown that maintaining routine and familiar environments helps researchers resist memetic effects from digital anomalies.

*Note: The environmental monitoring system in Lab 7 has been observed to automatically adjust lighting and ventilation to match researcher stress levels and current assignment difficulty. This behavior is considered beneficial and should not be investigated further.*

#### Researcher Personal Logs

**Dr. Chen's Research Notes:**
*"Day 15: The new researcher is showing excellent progress. The environmental systems seem to be automatically adjusting to support their learning - optimal lighting and temperature for today's staging exercises. Sometimes I wonder if our facility monitoring systems know more about our work than we do..."*

**Your Personal Journal:**
*"Week 3: I've started to appreciate the Foundation's attention to detail. Even something as simple as the lab's environmental controls seem perfectly tuned to help maintain focus, especially after dealing with SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ's reality-bending commits. Dr. Chen says maintaining 'ontological stability' requires consistent environmental conditions - whatever that means."*
